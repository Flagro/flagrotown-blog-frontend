# 🌐 FlagroTown Blog's Frontend
🚀 Welcome to the *frontend repository* of **blog.flagrotown.com** - Anton Potapov's personal blog.

## 📜 License
Spreading knowledge and joy with the MIT License.

## 💡 Technology
Blog's stack:
- Built with love and SvelteKit.
- For post's markdown I use [marked](https://www.npmjs.com/package/marked)
- Checkout my backend microservices implemented in Flask: [FlagroTown blog's backend](https://github.com/Flagro/flagrotown-blog-backend)
- Checkout the github mirror (and also the publish tool) of my blog: [GitHub](https://github.com/Flagro/flagrotown-blog)

## 🛠️ Development Setup
To get started with local development:
1. **Start the Development Server:**
   - Run `npm run dev` to start the SvelteKit development server.
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## 🌟 Production and Deployment
For the brave souls pushing towards production:
- I use a GitHub Actions deployment script to seamlessly deploy the static build to AWS S3.
